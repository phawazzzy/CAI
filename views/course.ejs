                    <h3>Robotics</h3>
                    <p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical
                        engineering,
                        electronic engineering, informationengineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals
                        with the
                        design,construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems fortheir control,
                        sensory
                        feedback, and information processing.</p>
                    <p>These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute forhumans and replicate human
                        actions. Robots can be used in many situationsand for lots of purposes, but today many are used
                        in
                        dangerous environments(including bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes,
                        orwhere
                        humans cannot survive (e.g. in space). Robots can take on any form butsome are made to resemble
                        humans
                        in appearance. This is said to help in theacceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors
                        usually
                        performed bypeople. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition,
                        andbasically
                        anything a human can do. Many of today's robots are inspired bynature, contributing to the field
                        of
                        bio-inspired robotics.</p>
                    <p>The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back toclassical times, but
                        research
                        into the functionality and potential uses of robotsdid not grow substantially until the 20th
                        century.
                        Throughout history, it hasbeen frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and
                        technicians that robots will one day be able tomimic human behavior and manage tasks in a
                        human-like
                        fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, astechnological advances continue;
                        researching,
                        designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes,whether domestically,
                        commercially,
                        or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people such asdefusing
                        bombs,
                        finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks. Robotics is also used
                        in
                        STEM(science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid.[1] The advent of
                        nanorobots,
                        microscopic robotsthat can be injected into the human body, could revolutionize medicine and
                        human
                        health.[</p>
                    <p>Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and
                        operation of
                        robots. This fieldoverlaps with electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence,
                        mechatronics,
                        nanotechnology and bioengineering.</p>
